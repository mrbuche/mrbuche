Greetings!

Iâ€™m [@mrbuche](https://github.com/mrbuche), a postdoc at [@sandialabs](https://github.com/sandialabs).

I'm generally interested in anything related to mechanics, and I have a particular interest in statistical thermodynamics.

Feel free to look around here or on my [website](https://mrbuche.github.io).
